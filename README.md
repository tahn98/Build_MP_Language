## MP Language 
MP (Mini Pascal) is a language which consists of a subset of Pascal plus some Java language features. The Pascal features of this language are (details will be discussed later): a few primitive types, one-dimensional arrays, control structures, expressions, compound statements (i.e., blocks), functions and procedures. The Java features of this language are as follows:
1. MP has multiple assignments, borrowed from Java. 
2. In MP, like Java, the operands of an operator are guaranteed to be evaluated in a speciﬁc evaluation order, particularly, from left to right. In Pascal, the evaluation order is left unspeciﬁed. In the case of f() + g(), for example, MP dictates that f is always evaluated before g.
